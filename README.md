# Ugly Webby

For our first CSS activity, we aren't going to have the difficult job of having a vision in mind and trying to make it happen with CSS. In fact, we're going to be taking a reasonable looking (if not beautiful) site and making it as _unreasonable_ looking as possible.

Fork and clone this repo, then check out style.css. Play with the values, add new property-value combinations (maybe play with the `background-color` property?), add CSS rules for other selectors (`h3` for example doesn't have any rules for it yet!), and just generally mess stuff _up_.

_Don't change the html at all_ (except possibly adding classes and ids, but this is totally optional). `style.css`, on the other hand, is your personal playground.

Or more like your tower of blocks to knock over and your walls to crayon across.

We look forward to seeing what ugly phoenix rises from this repo's ashes. Good luck!

## An Important Guideline

This project is fun, but the main priority is _learning_.

As a result, although, there are many things you could do to uglify this site, you should prioritize experimenting with CSS properties.

Here are some examples to illustrate:

- Instead of including many off-putting background images and gifs using a couple of properties,  try playing with the `transform` property, which has _many_ possible uses.
- Instead of choosing an entire palette of mismatched colors for the `color` property, choose one mismatch and spend your time trying each possible `position` value. (`sticky` is fun!)

Have fun, and remember that learning can be fun as long as its creative.

Or destructive!

Yeah, never mind creativity. Destructive is _way_ more fun.
